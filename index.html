        Welcome to Battleship! The goal of the game is to sink all of the ships
        by guessing the location on a grid.

      <p class="instruct">
        The computer will start with a fleet of three ships placed on a 9x7
        grid. You will then place bombs by clicking on cells.
      </p>
      <p class="instruct">
        If a ship is located at the guessed coordinate, it is considered a
        "hit". This will be represented by pink bomb icon. If the guess is a
        miss, this will br represented by a blue X. Once a ship sinks, the icons
        will change to a dark red ship symbol.
      </p>
      <p class="instruct">
        The number of tries it takes you to sink the ships is recorded. Try and
        keep it as low as possible!
